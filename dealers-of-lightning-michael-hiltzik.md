The Alto aimed to be not a machine of its time, but of the future. Computer memory was horrifically expensive at the moment, true, but it was getting cheaper every week. At the rate prices were falling, the same memory that cost ten grand in 1973 would be available in 1983 for thirty dollars. The governing principle of PARC was that the place existed to give their employer that ten-year head start on the future. They even contrived a shorthand phrase to explain the concept. The Alto, they said, was a time machine.

One was Xerox’s money, a seemingly limitless cascade of cash flowing from its near-monopoly on the office copier. The second was a buyer’s market for high-caliber research talent. With the expenses and politics of the Vietnam War cutting into the government’s research budget and a nationwide recession exerting the same effect on corporate research, Xerox was one of the rare enterprises in a position to bid for the best scientists and engineers around.

---

The final factor was management. PARC was founded by men whose experience had taught them that the only way to get the best research was to hire the best researchers they could find and leave them unburdened by directives, instructions, or deadlines.

“The notion of a human being having to punch holes in lots of cards, keep these cards straight, and then take this deck of what might be hundreds and hundreds of cards to a computer… You come back the next day and find out that your program executed up until card 433 and then stopped because you left out a comma. You fix that and this time the program gets to card 4006 and stops because you forgot to punch an O instead of a zero or some other stupid reason. It was bleak.” Taylor perceived the need for something entirely new. “I started talking functionally,” he said. He asked himself: Which organ provides the greatest bandwidth in terms of its access to the human brain? Obviously, the eyeball. If one then contemplated how the computer could best communicate with its human operator, the answer suggested itself. “I thought the machine should concentrate its resources on the display.”

By 1962, however, when Licklider was tapped to run a new Information Processing Techniques Office, or IPTO, the urgency had waned. Whatever military orientation ARPA still harbored was visible only as a sort of artifact, as when Licklider discovered by accident that one “cloak-and-dagger” project under his nominal jurisdiction was so highly classified even he was not cleared to know what it was. (“That made me nervous,” he admitted later.) 

ARPA had refocused itself on civilian research in broad scientific areas, some of them having only tenuous relevance to national security. “I did not feel much pressure to make a military case for anything,” Licklider told an interviewer years later. Of course, the Pentagon did expect that the agency’s work might serendipitously lead to. solutions of some of its technical problems, such as the vexing issue of “command and control”: how to employ effectively the immense volume of information generated on a battlefield to manage the armed forces’ increasingly elaborate weapons systems. 

For years the military had viewed this issue in terms of training the human beings with their fingers on the triggers. Licklider informed his bosses that the real solution lay in making the machine meet the human halfway. This was something he called “man-computer symbiosis,” a subject on which he happened to have published a paper two years earlier. Traditionally, problems had to be written and presented to the computer very carefully so the machine would understand every step. One tiny error, and all computation would cease. Try planning a battle under these conditions—you would be obliterated before reaching the second step in the process. But what if the system were designed so the computer was no longer a mute data manipulator, but a participant in a dialogue—something, he had written in that paper, like “a colleague whose competence supplements your own?”

Ivan Sutherland was a brilliant MIT graduate who happened to be serving with the Army as a first lieutenant. Only twenty-six, he had already amassed an enviable research record, the crowning achievement of which had been the development of the first interactive computer graphics program. Known as Sketchpad, the system allowed a user to draw highly detailed and complex drawings directly on a computer’s cathode-ray screen using a light pen and store them in memory.

Nothing of the kind ever occurred at Xerox research. The Webster engineering and research staff treated the new science of computer-aided design with utter indifference. Webster’s classically educated chemists, physicists, and metallurgists devoted their attention to narrow, product-oriented tasks, trying to develop better toners and photoreceptors to drop into copiers designed the same old way. As far as that went they were talented enough, but they had no incentive to keep up with new research techniques. As for applying imagination to an entirely new science, concept, or machine, Webster was hopeless. It was not research as Jack Goldman understood the word; it was product development, which was something very different.

“Real research people tend to interact with the world at large,” he observed. “They know what’s happening on the university campuses and get invited back and forth, so they become an avenue through which you can attract new ideas into the company. Research is a funnel through which you can bring in people who normally won’t talk to the guys down in the trenches designing equipment,” he said. Xerox had not been getting new ideas, and it showed.

The architecture of information: The phrase might as well have been chiseled over the doors of the hilltop palace Xerox would soon build to house a group of employees quite unlike any others the company had ever placed on its payroll. “It was a great phrase,” one PARC engineer said later, “because nobody knew exactly what it meant. So there were quite a few interesting things you could do and simply cite that as the justification.”

---

Pake hesitated, wondering about Xerox’s resolve over the long haul. “I had a lot of friends at other industrial research establishments and the usual thing they were worried about was the feast-or-famine effect,” he said later. “You know, in the good business years the company invests in research, but in the bad years they want to pull out.” That was a recipe for wasting millions of dollars. “Research is a steady-state thing. You can’t just turn it on and off.”

---

“I said if you hire me you will get nothing of business value in five years,” he recalled. “But if you don’t have something of value in ten years, then you’ll know you’ve hired the wrong guy.”

---

Pake directed Goldman’s attention westward.

---

Jones, Squires, and Gloria Warner, a senior secretary who relocated from Webster to work for Pake, spent the next week working like char-women. With brooms, buckets, and mops purchased from the nearest K Mart, they swept up the accumulated filth themselves and installed a rickety table and chairs in the clearing.

Taylor’s capacious net would come to embrace areas of computer research that barely existed when ARPA delivered its lifesaving shot to Wes Clark’s project. At ARPA he funded the country’s first full-fledged graduate degree programs in computer science at Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon, and MIT. Some fields of study virtually owed their existence to his largesse. Among them was computer graphics, which came to life at the University of Utah when Dave Evans, a devout Mormon who had led the Genie team building the time-sharing SDS 940 at UC Berkeley, called Taylor to say his alma mater had invited him to return to Salt Lake to start a computer program. How about an ARPA project, he asked, to get it going? Computer graphics was then attracting almost no one’s attention, for the simple reason that most computers lacked visual displays of any kind. If Evans was willing to start such a program in the backwater of Utah, where it could develop in pristine isolation from the traditionalist thinking elsewhere, Taylor was all for it. The venture turned out better than anyone could have expected. The program Taylor funded partially as a personal experiment and partially as a favor to an old friend evolved into a world leader in computer graphics research. His most enduring legacy, however, was not a university program but a leap of intuition that tied together everything else he had done. This was the ARPANET, the precursor of today’s Internet.

Whether they were at MIT, Stanford, or UCLA, researchers were all looking for answers to the same general questions. “These people began to know one another, share a lot of information, and ask of one another, ‘How do I use this? Where do I find that?’” Taylor recalled. “It was really phenomenal to see this computer become a medium that stimulated the formation of a human community.” There was still a long way to go before reaching that ideal, however. The community was less like a nation than a swarm of tribal hamlets, often mutually unintelligible or even mutually hostile. Design differences among their machines kept many groups digitally isolated from the others. The risk was that each institution would develop its own unique and insular culture, like related species of birds evolving independently on islands in a vast uncharted sea. Pondering how to bind them into a larger whole, Taylor sought a way for all groups to interact via their computers, each island community enjoying constant access to the others’ machines as though they all lived on one contiguous virtual continent.

The notion that any arm of the Pentagon could engage in wholly innocent and purely civilian research incited mistrust across the country. As a defensive measure, ARPA started to shed its civilian entanglements and consciously remake itself into what the nation thought it was anyway—an arm of the war machine. When the Caltech engineer Eberhardt Rechtin succeeded Herzfeld as director in 1967, he assured his congressional overseers he would nudge ARPA toward “mission-oriented” objectives—programs aimed at satisfying chiefly military goals. The 1969 Mansfield Amendment to the military appropriations bill would formalize the trend, directing the Pentagon henceforth to fund only projects of obvious military relevance. As if to underscore the point, the amendment changed ARPA’s name to DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

---

Taylor beheld the emasculation of government research with frank alarm. “Most of the time I was there ARPA was going for projects with an order-of-magnitude impact on the state of the science,” he reflected. “We had made a decision that we would not go for incremental things. But as soon as you get mission orientation you’re focusing on very narrow objectives.”

In Pake’s hard science universe, where researchers laid their bricks upon foundations that had been built as long as three centuries earlier, a doctorate was a certificate of genuine originality and achievement. That was not true in the fledgling science of computing, which was erecting its own academic foundation as it went along. Nor did Pake’s viewpoint apply very well to Taylor’s unique abilities as a master motivator of top research talent, which could never be encompassed within the rubric of any advanced university degree.

---

All he asked to be spelled out was Pake’s understanding that Xerox’s cherished “office of the future” would embrace networking and interactive computers. Pake agreed without devoting much thought to what those terms implied.

Pake also established by the close of 1970 a full research agenda. In a corporate memo dated January 4, 1971, he outlined an ambitious program for his group of twenty-three, augmented by another eight or ten professionals due to start work over the following few months. The Systems Science Lab was to take over development of a laser-driven computer printer whose inventor, a Webster engineer, had come west after failing to interest his bosses in its potential. SSL researchers would also investigate optical memories, a technology that would eventually give rise to today’s compact disc and CD-ROM, and speech recognition by computer. Taylor’s Computer Science Lab was to pursue his pet interest in graphics while developing specifications for a basic center-wide computer system. And GSL was assigned studies in solid-state technologies, including the electrical and optical qualities of crystals.
