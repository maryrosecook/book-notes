The Alto aimed to be not a machine of its time, but of the future. Computer memory was horrifically expensive at the moment, true, but it was getting cheaper every week. At the rate prices were falling, the same memory that cost ten grand in 1973 would be available in 1983 for thirty dollars. The governing principle of PARC was that the place existed to give their employer that ten-year head start on the future. They even contrived a shorthand phrase to explain the concept. The Alto, they said, was a time machine.

One was Xerox’s money, a seemingly limitless cascade of cash flowing from its near-monopoly on the office copier. The second was a buyer’s market for high-caliber research talent. With the expenses and politics of the Vietnam War cutting into the government’s research budget and a nationwide recession exerting the same effect on corporate research, Xerox was one of the rare enterprises in a position to bid for the best scientists and engineers around.

---

The final factor was management. PARC was founded by men whose experience had taught them that the only way to get the best research was to hire the best researchers they could find and leave them unburdened by directives, instructions, or deadlines.

“The notion of a human being having to punch holes in lots of cards, keep these cards straight, and then take this deck of what might be hundreds and hundreds of cards to a computer… You come back the next day and find out that your program executed up until card 433 and then stopped because you left out a comma. You fix that and this time the program gets to card 4006 and stops because you forgot to punch an O instead of a zero or some other stupid reason. It was bleak.” Taylor perceived the need for something entirely new. “I started talking functionally,” he said. He asked himself: Which organ provides the greatest bandwidth in terms of its access to the human brain? Obviously, the eyeball. If one then contemplated how the computer could best communicate with its human operator, the answer suggested itself. “I thought the machine should concentrate its resources on the display.”

By 1962, however, when Licklider was tapped to run a new Information Processing Techniques Office, or IPTO, the urgency had waned. Whatever military orientation ARPA still harbored was visible only as a sort of artifact, as when Licklider discovered by accident that one “cloak-and-dagger” project under his nominal jurisdiction was so highly classified even he was not cleared to know what it was. (“That made me nervous,” he admitted later.) 

ARPA had refocused itself on civilian research in broad scientific areas, some of them having only tenuous relevance to national security. “I did not feel much pressure to make a military case for anything,” Licklider told an interviewer years later. Of course, the Pentagon did expect that the agency’s work might serendipitously lead to. solutions of some of its technical problems, such as the vexing issue of “command and control”: how to employ effectively the immense volume of information generated on a battlefield to manage the armed forces’ increasingly elaborate weapons systems. 

For years the military had viewed this issue in terms of training the human beings with their fingers on the triggers. Licklider informed his bosses that the real solution lay in making the machine meet the human halfway. This was something he called “man-computer symbiosis,” a subject on which he happened to have published a paper two years earlier. Traditionally, problems had to be written and presented to the computer very carefully so the machine would understand every step. One tiny error, and all computation would cease. Try planning a battle under these conditions—you would be obliterated before reaching the second step in the process. But what if the system were designed so the computer was no longer a mute data manipulator, but a participant in a dialogue—something, he had written in that paper, like “a colleague whose competence supplements your own?”

Ivan Sutherland was a brilliant MIT graduate who happened to be serving with the Army as a first lieutenant. Only twenty-six, he had already amassed an enviable research record, the crowning achievement of which had been the development of the first interactive computer graphics program. Known as Sketchpad, the system allowed a user to draw highly detailed and complex drawings directly on a computer’s cathode-ray screen using a light pen and store them in memory.

---

Nothing of the kind ever occurred at Xerox research. The Webster engineering and research staff treated the new science of computer-aided design with utter indifference. Webster’s classically educated chemists, physicists, and metallurgists devoted their attention to narrow, product-oriented tasks, trying to develop better toners and photoreceptors to drop into copiers designed the same old way. As far as that went they were talented enough, but they had no incentive to keep up with new research techniques. As for applying imagination to an entirely new science, concept, or machine, Webster was hopeless. It was not research as Jack Goldman understood the word; it was product development, which was something very different.

---

“Real research people tend to interact with the world at large,” he observed. “They know what’s happening on the university campuses and get invited back and forth, so they become an avenue through which you can attract new ideas into the company. Research is a funnel through which you can bring in people who normally won’t talk to the guys down in the trenches designing equipment,” he said. Xerox had not been getting new ideas, and it showed.

---

The architecture of information: The phrase might as well have been chiseled over the doors of the hilltop palace Xerox would soon build to house a group of employees quite unlike any others the company had ever placed on its payroll. “It was a great phrase,” one PARC engineer said later, “because nobody knew exactly what it meant. So there were quite a few interesting things you could do and simply cite that as the justification.”

---

Pake hesitated, wondering about Xerox’s resolve over the long haul. “I had a lot of friends at other industrial research establishments and the usual thing they were worried about was the feast-or-famine effect,” he said later. “You know, in the good business years the company invests in research, but in the bad years they want to pull out.” That was a recipe for wasting millions of dollars. “Research is a steady-state thing. You can’t just turn it on and off.”

---

“I said if you hire me you will get nothing of business value in five years,” he recalled. “But if you don’t have something of value in ten years, then you’ll know you’ve hired the wrong guy.”

---

Pake directed Goldman’s attention westward.

---

Jones, Squires, and Gloria Warner, a senior secretary who relocated from Webster to work for Pake, spent the next week working like char-women. With brooms, buckets, and mops purchased from the nearest K Mart, they swept up the accumulated filth themselves and installed a rickety table and chairs in the clearing.

Taylor’s capacious net would come to embrace areas of computer research that barely existed when ARPA delivered its lifesaving shot to Wes Clark’s project. At ARPA he funded the country’s first full-fledged graduate degree programs in computer science at Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon, and MIT. Some fields of study virtually owed their existence to his largesse. Among them was computer graphics, which came to life at the University of Utah when Dave Evans, a devout Mormon who had led the Genie team building the time-sharing SDS 940 at UC Berkeley, called Taylor to say his alma mater had invited him to return to Salt Lake to start a computer program. How about an ARPA project, he asked, to get it going? Computer graphics was then attracting almost no one’s attention, for the simple reason that most computers lacked visual displays of any kind. If Evans was willing to start such a program in the backwater of Utah, where it could develop in pristine isolation from the traditionalist thinking elsewhere, Taylor was all for it. The venture turned out better than anyone could have expected. The program Taylor funded partially as a personal experiment and partially as a favor to an old friend evolved into a world leader in computer graphics research. His most enduring legacy, however, was not a university program but a leap of intuition that tied together everything else he had done. This was the ARPANET, the precursor of today’s Internet.

---

Whether they were at MIT, Stanford, or UCLA, researchers were all looking for answers to the same general questions. “These people began to know one another, share a lot of information, and ask of one another, ‘How do I use this? Where do I find that?’” Taylor recalled. “It was really phenomenal to see this computer become a medium that stimulated the formation of a human community.” There was still a long way to go before reaching that ideal, however. The community was less like a nation than a swarm of tribal hamlets, often mutually unintelligible or even mutually hostile. Design differences among their machines kept many groups digitally isolated from the others. The risk was that each institution would develop its own unique and insular culture, like related species of birds evolving independently on islands in a vast uncharted sea. Pondering how to bind them into a larger whole, Taylor sought a way for all groups to interact via their computers, each island community enjoying constant access to the others’ machines as though they all lived on one contiguous virtual continent.

---

The notion that any arm of the Pentagon could engage in wholly innocent and purely civilian research incited mistrust across the country. As a defensive measure, ARPA started to shed its civilian entanglements and consciously remake itself into what the nation thought it was anyway—an arm of the war machine. When the Caltech engineer Eberhardt Rechtin succeeded Herzfeld as director in 1967, he assured his congressional overseers he would nudge ARPA toward “mission-oriented” objectives—programs aimed at satisfying chiefly military goals. The 1969 Mansfield Amendment to the military appropriations bill would formalize the trend, directing the Pentagon henceforth to fund only projects of obvious military relevance. As if to underscore the point, the amendment changed ARPA’s name to DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

---

Taylor beheld the emasculation of government research with frank alarm. “Most of the time I was there ARPA was going for projects with an order-of-magnitude impact on the state of the science,” he reflected. “We had made a decision that we would not go for incremental things. But as soon as you get mission orientation you’re focusing on very narrow objectives.”

---

In Pake’s hard science universe, where researchers laid their bricks upon foundations that had been built as long as three centuries earlier, a doctorate was a certificate of genuine originality and achievement. That was not true in the fledgling science of computing, which was erecting its own academic foundation as it went along. Nor did Pake’s viewpoint apply very well to Taylor’s unique abilities as a master motivator of top research talent, which could never be encompassed within the rubric of any advanced university degree.

---

All he asked to be spelled out was Pake’s understanding that Xerox’s cherished “office of the future” would embrace networking and interactive computers. Pake agreed without devoting much thought to what those terms implied.

---

Pake also established by the close of 1970 a full research agenda. In a corporate memo dated January 4, 1971, he outlined an ambitious program for his group of twenty-three, augmented by another eight or ten professionals due to start work over the following few months. The Systems Science Lab was to take over development of a laser-driven computer printer whose inventor, a Webster engineer, had come west after failing to interest his bosses in its potential. SSL researchers would also investigate optical memories, a technology that would eventually give rise to today’s compact disc and CD-ROM, and speech recognition by computer. Taylor’s Computer Science Lab was to pursue his pet interest in graphics while developing specifications for a basic center-wide computer system. And GSL was assigned studies in solid-state technologies, including the electrical and optical qualities of crystals.

---

With scant equipment of any value on the premises, the building stayed unlocked and hospitable to outsiders. “We were physically adjacent to Stanford University, so there were visitors dropping in and out of the lab all the time. A lot of us even came to feel we were sort of like university instructors who got to spend all our time doing research without having to teach classes. So we operated as though this were an open environment where we were free to share what we were doing with anyone we wanted to.”

---

In a superb buyers’ market for research and engineering talent, PARC’s lavish budget and open-ended charter stood alone among corporate entities. Other industrial research centers might enjoy generous funding or comparably liberal charters, but none had both the open checkbook and apparent immunity from product development pressures enjoyed by PARC.

---

He was right about that. Toward the end of 1970 Taylor called in some of his old chits to stage a pair of dazzling heists. The first was a raid on the only laboratory on the West Coast—possibly the country—whose work on interactive computing met his stern standards. The lab belonged to the legendary engineer Douglas C. Engelbart, an adamantine visionary who held court out of a small think tank called SRI, or the Stanford Research Institute, a couple of miles north of Palo Alto in the community of Menlo Park. There Engelbart had established his “Augmentation Research Center.” The name derived from his conviction that the computer was not only capable of assisting the human thought process, but reinventing it on a higher plane. The “augmentation of human intellect,” as he defined it, meant that the computer’s ability to store, classify, and retrieve information would someday alter the very way people thought, wrote, and figured.

---

His essay dealt chiefly with technology’s ability to manage information. Bush discerned the birth of what would come to be called the “information glut” and projected it forward to a cacophonous posterity. “Publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record,” he wrote. “The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.” Himself the inventor of a successful analog computer, Bush understood that computer technology might help society draw sense out of the chaos. He sketched out something called the “memex,” which he described as “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” The mechanism of consultation would be “associative indexing… whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex.”

---

Engelbart linked video terminals to mainframes by cable and communicated with the machines via televised images. To allow the user to move the insertion point, or cursor, from place to place in a block of text instantaneously, he outfitted a hollowed-out block of wood with two small wheels fixed at right angles so it could be rolled smoothly over a flat surface. The wheels communicated their motion to potentiometers whose signals in turn were translated by the computer into the placement of the cursor on the screen. From this crude device would spring an entire culture. “No one is quite sure why it got named a ‘mouse,’” Engelbart said years later. “None of us thought that the name would have stayed with it, out in the world.” The entire interactive system—mouse, screen, computer, software, and underlying philosophy—was known by the acronym “NLS,” for “oNLine System.”

---

Until 1968 Engelbart and his aides labored in relative obscurity, their work known only within the insular fraternity of government grant-makers and computer theorists. That year he requested ninety minutes to demonstrate NLS at the Fall Joint Computer Conference of two leading engineering societies, scheduled for San Francisco in December. The result was one of the most famous events in computing history. The mouse, making its first public appearance, was the least of it. Engelbart and his sixteen assistants stretched existing electronic technology nearly to the breaking point. He recalled later: “We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset, and keyboard and piped them down to SRI [that is, Stanford Research Institute] over a telephone hookup. We leased two microwave lines up from our laboratory, roughly thirty miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck on Skyline Boulevard, and two on the roof of the conference center. It cost money… The nice people at ARPA and NASA, who were funding us, effectively had to say, ‘Don’t tell me!’” The effort was worth every penny. The audience was riveted, as Engelbart in his subdued drone described and demonstrated a fully operational system of interactive video conferencing, multimedia displays, and split-screen technology. At one point half of a twenty-foot-tall projection screen was occupied by a live video image of Engelbart on stage, the other half by text transmitted live from Menlo Park (it was a shopping list including apples, oranges, bean soup, and French bread). Minutes later the screen carried a live video image of a hand rolling the unusual “mouse” around a desktop while a superimposed computer display showed how the cursor simultaneously and obediently followed its path.

---

Engelbart’s self-defined mission was not to produce a product, or even a prototype; it was an open-ended search for knowledge. Consequently, no project in his lab ever seemed to come to an end. Whenever one approached a milestone he would abruptly redefine it, condemning the lab to months or years of further work. The finish line was constantly receding, like the oasis in a desert mirage. Said one long-term member of his lab: “We were like rats running in his maze.”

---

Bill English had been the invisible guiding hand behind the 1968 demo. He was ferociously loyal to his boss but bridled at the lab’s perpetual lack of closure. Some also believed he was fed up with Engelbart’s way of monopolizing credit for the lab’s accomplishments. Taylor offered English a solution to both complaints: reproduce NLS, or something like it, at PARC. English could thus fulfill his treasured goal of bringing the system to commercial fruition and be in charge of his own lab, out from under the shadow of the implacable Engelbart. Whether English hesitated leaving the leader he had followed for nearly a decade is hard to say, but he continued the raid where Taylor left off, eventually recruiting a dozen of Engelbart’s most important followers.

---

The BCC pioneers were about to become victims of the “second-system effect.” The theory of second systems was formulated by an IBM executive named Frederick Brooks, whose career supervising large-scale software teams taught him that designers of computer systems tend to build into their second projects all the pet features that tight finances or short deadlines forced them to leave out of their first. The result is an overgrown, inefficient monstrosity that rarely works as expected. As he put it in his pithy masterpiece, The Mythical Man-Month: “The second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.” The BCC machine could have sprung full-blown from the pages of Brooks’s text. As Lampson recalled, the designers of the economical and practical SDS 940 regarded their next machine as an opportunity to “look at all the things you could make much more wonderful, and plan to make them all more wonderful by creating a system that could handle a lot more users and much larger programs and was much faster and used computing resources much more efficiently and was better and more wonderful in every possible way. “It was not a very realistic enterprise,” he acknowledged. “But at the time it seemed great, the proper next step, as second systems often do.”

---

Some of the workers, including Thacker, could tell early on that the project was getting out of hand. The engineer’s engineer possessed the unique trait of aiming for less, not more, in his systems. “This was so unusual for an engineer,” recalled Charles Simonyi

---

Just as BCC filed for bankruptcy (one final drunken party on Friday, November 13, 1970, drained the last of its petty cash), PARC hired six of its best people—Lampson, Thacker, Deutsch, Fiala, a hardware designer named Richard Shoup, and a software programmer named Jim Mitchell.

---

Taylor had completed his team—almost. He had the best hardware man (Thacker), the best designer of operating systems (Lampson), and an entire cell of other computer science prodigies.

---

The BCC group, deeply rooted in the culture of time-sharing, was still intent on getting as many users hooked into a single machine as technologically possible. That goal, as Wes Clark contended, remained incompatible with giving the individual the kind of speed and responsiveness that interactivity required.

---

But one man was way ahead of them all. That one had written a doctoral thesis at Utah in 1969 describing an idealized interactive computer called the FLEX machine. He had experimented with powerful displays and with computers networked in intricate configurations. On page after page of his dissertation he lamented the inability of the world’s existing hardware to realize his dream of an interactive personal computer. He set before science the challenge to build the machine he imagined, one with “enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing, enough capacity to store thousands of pages, poems, letters, recipes, records, drawings, animations, musical scores, and anything else you would like to remember and change.” To Taylor he was a soulmate and a profound thinker, capable of seeing a computing future far beyond anything even he could imagine. Among the computer scientists familiar with his ideas, half thought he was a crackpot and the other half a visionary. His name was Alan Kay.

---

Ideaspace Central today is divided between two Southern California locations about ten miles apart. One is Kay’s home in an affluent part of Los Angeles. It is unassuming from the outside except for a towering V-roofed addition. This curious annex was custom-built to shelter a two-story pipe organ professionally hand-crafted of exquisite blond spruce, on which Kay can be heard almost any morning practicing his favorite music by Buxtehude and J. S. Bach. (“ Alan believed his role was to make it possible to build the organ, after which he would be the happy caretaker,” remarked its architect, Greg Harrold.) The second location is a warehouse-like building in Glendale, a smoggy precinct of the San Gabriel Valley just north of L.A. Artfully arranged partitions and bookcases provide Kay with a spacious work area open to the floor through a doorless passage on one side—not too private, for he likes to spend the workday in constant stir, eliciting and dispensing ideas among his co-workers with equal generosity. He greets you wearing an oval name tag reading “Alan” and bearing a picture of Mickey Mouse. It should look ludicrous and it does, until you remember that this is the man whose playful digitized image of Cookie Monster launched the age of the personal computer. Or that he is now employed—as are two other members of the extraordinary team he assembled at PARC—by the Walt Disney Company, which has entrusted him with helping to develop new ways to transmit story and idea from creator to audience.

---

“Alan had been thrown out of every university in the country,” recalled John Warnock,

---

This notion of technology as a means to an end still distinguishes Kay from most other practitioners of the art and science of technology. One factor in his powerful kinship with Bob Taylor was their shared curiosity about what this machine could be made to do, more than how. Notwithstanding his incessant harangues, most of the inspired engineers Taylor recruited to CSL, the Lampsons and Thackers, started out too blindly focused on the issue of what was within their power to actually build. They would ask: What is the next stop on the road? Kay turned the question inside out: Let’s figure out where we want to go, and that will show us how to get there. He never lost sight of the computer’s appropriate station in the world: to conform to the user’s desires, not the other way around.

“People get trapped in thinking that anything in the environment is to be taken as a given. It’s part of the way our nervous system works. But it’s dangerous to take it as a given because then it controls you, rather than the other way around. That’s McLuhan’s insight, one of the bigger ones in the twentieth century. Zen in the twentieth century is about taking things that have been rendered invisible by this process and trying to make them visible again.

Jeffers was a junior, a year behind Kay (although since Kay’s illness lost him a year of school, they graduated together). He was also a superb pianist with perfect pitch and a thriving jazz band. Kay joined up on guitar. The band played Dixieland jazz from Jeffers’s effortless arrangements, an interesting choice if one is looking for a form that imposes strict formal rules on players who are encouraged to break them according to another set of strict formal rules.

The title read, “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communications System.” The 1963 MIT doctoral thesis of Ivan Sutherland, Taylor’s predecessor at IPTO, the paper described a program that had become the cornerstone of the young science of interactive computer graphics. Sketchpad worked on only one machine in the world, Wes Clark’s TX-2 at Lincoln Lab. But its precepts were infinitely applicable to a whole range of increasingly nimble and powerful computers then coming into existence. Sketchpad was also, by Evans’s mandate, the cardinal introduction to computing in his doctoral program. “Basically,” Kay said, “you had to understand that before you were a real person at Utah.” Sutherland’s system could create graphic objects of dazzling complexity, all the more amazing given the severe limitations of the contemporary hardware. With Sketchpad the user could skew straight lines into curves (“ rubber-banding”), make engineering-precise lines and angles (the system straightened out the draftsman’s rough sketches), and zoom the display resolution in and out. The program pioneered the “virtual desktop,” in which the user sketched on the visible portion of a theoretical drawing space about one-third of a mile square (the invisible portions were held in the computer’s memory and could be scrolled into view). Contemplating the power of Sketchpad was “like seeing a glimpse of heaven,” Kay said later. “It had all of the kinds of things that the computer seemed to promise. You could think of it as a light that was sort of showing us the way.”
