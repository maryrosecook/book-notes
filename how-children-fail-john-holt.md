# How Children Fail - John Holt

## Preface to revised edition

He and his colleagues tried to find out what makes some schools “effective," by which they meant a school in which the percentage of poor children who learn a satisfactory amount of what they are supposed to learn in any grade, enough to be legitimately promoted, is the same as the proportion of middle-class or affluent children.

---

(1) if the students did not learn, the schools did not blame them, or their families, backgrounds, neighborhoods, attitudes, nervous systems, or whatever. They did not alibi. They took full responsibility for the results or non-results of their work. (2) When something they were doing in the class did not work, they stopped doing it, and tried to do something else. They flunked unsuccessful methods, not the children.

## Strategy

I thought I knew how to deal with the problem: make the work interesting and the classroom a lively and enthusiastic place. It was, too, many of these failing students actually liked my classes. Overcome children's fear of saying what they don't understand, and keep explaining until they do understand. Keep a steady and resolute pressure on them. These things I did. Result? The good students stayed good, and some may have got better; but the bad students stayed bad, and some of them seemed to get worse. If they were failing in November they were still failing in June. There must be a better answer. Maybe we can prevent kids from becoming chronic failers in the first place.

---

Part of being a good student is learning to be aware of that state of ones own mind and the degree of one's own understanding.

On the diagnostic spelling test, she spelled "tariff" as TEARERFIT. Today I thought I would try her again on it. This time she wrote TEARFIT. What does she do in such cases? Her reading aloud gives a clue. She closes her eyes and makes a dash for it, like someone running past a graveyard on a dark night. No looking back afterward, either.

---

Today she handed me, for display, a piece of tagboard on which she had pasted some jokes that a friend had cut out of a newspaper. I found when I got to the last one that she had put the paste on the joke side, so that all there was to read was the meaningless fragment of a news story. I was surprised that she would paste a joke on backwards, without even looking to see whether she had it on the right way. When it was posted, and the other kids were looking at it, I said to Emily, "You'll have to explain that last joke to us; we don't get it." I thought she might look at it, for the first time, see that it was meaningless, and realize that she had pasted it on backside up. To my amazement, she smiled and said with the utmost nonchalance, "As a matter of fact, I don't get it myself." She had looked at it. She was perfectly ready to accept the fact that she had posted a joke that was meaningless. The possibility that she had made a mistake, and that the real joke was on the other side, did not occur to her.

---

Of course, this is a strategy that often pays off, A teacher who asks a question is tuned to the right answer, ready to hear it, eager to hear it, since it will tell him that his teaching is good and that he can go on to the next topic. He will assume that anything that sounds close to the right answer is meant to be the right answer.

---

In the midst of all this, there came a vivid example of the kind of things we say in school that makes no sense, that only bewilders and confuses the thoughtful child who tries to make sense out of it.

The teacher, whose specialty, by the way, was English, had told these children that a verb is a word of action— which is not always true. One of the words she asked was "dream." She was thinking of the noun, and apparently did not remember that "dream" can as easily be a verb. One little boy, making a pure guess, said it was a verb. Here the teacher, to be helpful, contributed one of those "explanations" that are so much more hindrance than help. She said, "But a verb has to have action; can you give me a sentence, using 'dream,' that has action?" The child thought a bit, and said, "I had a dream about the Trojan War." Now it's pretty hard to get much more action than that. But the teacher told him he was wrong, and he sat silent, with an utterly baffled and frightened expression on his face. She was so busy thinking about what she wanted him to say, she was so obsessed with that right answer hidden in her mind, that she could not think about what he was really saying and thinking, could not see that his reasoning was logical and correct, and that the mistake was not his but hers.

---

He said that after reading the book he realized that his graduate students were using on him, and had used for the ten years and more he had been teaching there, all the evasive strategies I described in the book— mumble, guess-andlook, take a wild guess and see what happens, get the teacher to answer his own questions, etc. But as I later realized, these are the games that all humans play when others are sitting in judgment on them.

---

We had the problem "If you are traveling at 40 miles per hour, how long will it take you to go 10 miles?”
Walter: 4 minutes.
JH (me): How did you get it?
W: Divided the 40 by the 10. A quick look at my face told him that this would not do. After a while he wrote, "15 minutes." I wanted to check his understanding.
JH: If you were going 50 miles per hour, how far would you go in 24 minutes?
W: (quickly): 36 miles.
JH: How did you get that?
W: Subtracted 24 from 60. He still hadn't gotten it. I tried again.
JH: If you were going 50 miles per hour, how far would you go in 30 minutes?
W: 25 miles. 30 minutes is half an hour, and half of 50 is 25.

It sounded as if he knew what he was doing at last. I thought he would have no trouble with the 24 minutes problem. But it took a long time, with some hinting from me, before he saw that 24 minutes was 2/ 5 of an hour, and therefore that he would go 2/ 5 of 50 miles, or 20 miles, in 24 minutes. Would he have discovered it if I had not paved the way with leading questions? Hard to tell.

Most teachers would have assumed, as I would have once, that when he got the 15-minutes problem, he knew what he was doing. Even the skeptical the 15-minutes problem, he knew what he was doing. Even the skeptical minutes problem. Yet in each case he showed that he had not really understood what he was doing, and it is not at all certain that he understands yet.

What was his strategy here? Certainly he was numeral shoving. More than that he was making up a fairly sensible sounding explanation of how he was doing the problem. And yet, is it not possible, even probable, that in saying that in half an hour you go half of 50 miles, he was merely doing some word shoving to go along with his numeral shoving? The explanation sounded reasonable to me, because, in this case, his way of shoving the numerals happened to be the right way; but he was just as happy with his explanations when he was shoving the numerals the wrong way.

---

Of all I saw and learned this past half year, one thing stands out. What goes on in the class is not what teachers think-- certainly not what I had always thought. For years now I have worked with a picture in mind of what my class was like. This reality, which I felt I knew, was partly physical, partly mental or spiritual. In other words, I thought I knew, in general, what the students were doing, and also what they were thinking and feeling. I see now that my picture of reality was almost wholly false. Why didn’t I see this before?

---

They went on daydreaming, no matter how often they got caught and embarrassed doing it, because the class, despite our efforts to make it interesting and safe, was a boring, confusing, and dangerous place, from which they would escape if they could— and daydreaming was the only way to escape.

---

A teacher in class is like a man in the woods at night with a powerful flashlight in his hand. Wherever he turns his light, the creatures on whom it shines are aware of it, and do not behave as they do in the dark. Thus the mere fact of his watching their behavior changes it into something very different. Shine where be will, he can never know very much of the night life of the woods.

---

Student teachers in training spend long periods of time in one classroom, but they think they are in there to learn How To Teach, to pick up the tricks of child management from watching a Master At Work. Their concern is with manipulating and controlling children rather than understanding them. So they watch the teacher, see only what the teacher sees, and thus lose most of what could be a valuable experience.

---

The conscientious teacher thinks of himself as taking his students (at least part way) on a journey to some glorious destination, well worth the pains of the trip. If he teaches history, he thinks how interesting, how exciting, how useful it is to know history, and how fortunate his students will be when they begin to share his knowledge. If he teaches French, he thinks of the glories of French literature, or the beauty of spoken French, or the delights of French cooking, and how he is helping to make these joys available to his students. And so for all subjects.

Thus teachers feel, as I once did, that their interests and their students' are fundamentally the same. I used to feel that I was guiding and helping my students on a journey that they wanted to take but could not take without my help. I knew the way looked hard, but I assumed they could see the goal almost as clearly as I and that they were almost as eager to reach it. It seemed very important to give students this feeling of being on a journey to a worthwhile destination.

---

Schools give every encouragement to producers, the kids whose idea is to get "right answers" by any and all means. In a system that runs on "right answers," they can hardly help it. And these schools are often very discouraging places for thinkers.

---

Until recently it had not occurred to me that poor students thought differently about their work than good students; I assumed they thought the same way, only less skillfully. Now it begins to look as if the expectation and fear of failure, if strong enough, may lead children to act and think in a special way, to adopt strategies different from those of more confident children. Emily is a good example. She is emotionally as well as intellectually incapable of checking her work, of comparing her ideas against reality, of making any kind of judgment about the value of her thoughts.

---

The trouble was that I was asking too many questions. In time I learned to shut up and stop asking questions, stop constantly trying to find out how much people understood. We have to let learners decide when they want to ask questions. It often takes them a long time even to find out what questions they want to ask. It is not the teacher's proper task to be constantly testing and checking the understanding of the learner. That's the learner's task, and only the learner can do it. The teacher's job is to answer questions when learners ask them, or to try to help learners understand better when they ask for that help.

We were trying to find out what children understood so that we could help them understand better. But to them our tests of their understanding were just like any other kind of school tests. They just made them more nervous and confused than ever.

---

The funny thing is that I don't think he felt that one of these ideas was any better than another. He might one day say that horses and cows were similar in that they were domestic farm animals that ate grass; and the next day that they were alike because he had never ridden on either, or something like that. How can we help him to see that some ways of looking at things, ordering things, are more useful than others?

We have to convince the children that they must not be afraid to ask questions; but further than that, we must get across the idea that some questions are more useful than others, and that to the right kind of question the answer "No" can be as revealing as "Yes." Here is where Twenty Questions, the card game, the balance beam, all come in handy.

---

When Nancy and Sheila worked the balance beam last year, they were often close to the truth, but they could never hang on to it because they could never express their ideas in a form they could test with an experiment. Once one of them said, "Things weigh more further out." This was a big step; but they couldn't think of a way to check or refine this insight, they couldn't ask themselves (to use their terms) how much more things weigh when they get further out.

---

The very natural mistake that Bill and I made was to think that the differences between the children in our class had to do with techniques of thinking, that the successful kids had good techniques of thinking while the unsuccessful, the "producers," had bad, and therefore that our task was to teach better techniques. But the unsuccessful kids were not trying, however badly, to do the same things as the successful. They were doing something altogether different. They saw the school and their task in it differently. It was a place of danger, and their task was, as far as they could, to stay out of danger. Their business was not learning, but escaping.

About three years later I was working, among other things, as a special reading instructor or tutor in the school where for a couple of years I had taught fifth grade. I had persuaded the school to use in its first-grade classrooms Gattegno's Words in Color, a very ingenious set of materials, in which each sound of spoken English had its own color.

One of the boys I was tutoring was a seven year-old who was not learning to read and was resisting all efforts to teach him. So I was asked to work with him alone. My method was to take letters that I had cut out of one of the Words in Color charts, use these letters to make short syllables, and ask him to read them. I see now that it would probably have been better to let him make the syllables and/ or words and let me pronounce them— though from time to time we may also have worked in that way.

At any rate, I would use the letters to make a word like PAT. I'd ask him to read it, and he would. Then I would remove the P and put a C in its place, and ask him to read that. Gattegno called these "transformations," seeing how changing one letter in a word could change the sound of the word— a good idea. The boy would do three or four of these transformations perfectly correctly, though slowly— which meant, I see now, that he really could read, really did understand what reading was all about. But then all at once he would spring his nonsense syllable at me. It was always the same one. We might be working with words that had no letter I or T in them at all— say, RUN, FUN, BUN. Suddenly, when I asked him to read a word, he would say "stut." I would say, "What?" "Stut," he would say, calmly and clearly.

That word rocked me back. Just as I would begin to think "He's really getting it, he's getting the idea of words and sounds," along would come this absurd syllable. How could he have made such a mistake? What did it mean? How was I to deal with it?'

It took me a long time— many weeks or even months— to realize that when this boy said "Stut," he was not making a mistake at all. He was changing the situation. He had been doing one task that I had given him, to try to figure out the words I had put in front of him. Now he was doing a different task, getting himself a short rest, and me off his back for a while. Indeed, he was giving me a little task of my own, to figure out what in the world made him say "stut," and what in the world I was going to do about it. The ball had been in his court; now it was in mine.

Eventually I figured out what was happening. Perhaps it was the way he was looking at me— not at all the rather tense and concentrated way he looked at the words, but calmly and curiously. He was looking to see what I would do next. I was now his guinea pig, not he mine.

Since by this time I already knew the strategy of guess-and-look, I had learned, when I gave him a word to decode, to turn away so that he could not see my face. If he made a wrong guess or choice, I simply sat there and waited for him to make another. I said nothing; I let him be in charge of the pace of our work. But when he said "stut," I usually turned round to look at him. In time I learned not to do that. When he said "stut," I said nothing, did not move, just waited. Often there might be a silence of a minute or two. Then the boy, having meanwhile had a nice rest, would realize that somehow the ball had got out of my court and back into his. After a while he would go on with his work.

None of this accomplished much, for reasons not clear to me then but much clearer now. This boy could in fact read, could "decode" simple words. But he did not want to, and had decided to refuse to.

It would probably have been much more useful for him and for me if I had used our time together to read aloud to him from books of his choosing, or let him read them silently, with the understanding that whenever he wanted, he could ask me what a word meant and I would tell him— without any questions, explanations, or sound-it-outs.

---

Worth noting here that a couple of years later, when I put a balance beam and some Weights on a table at the back of class, and just left it there without saying anything about it or trying to "teach" it, most of the children in the class, including some very poor students, figured out just by messing around with it how it worked.

## To Summarise

By intelligence we mean a style of life, a way of behaving in various situations, and particularly in new, strange, and perplexing situations. The true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do, but how we behave when we don't know what to do.

The intelligent person, young or old, meeting a new situation or problem, opens himself up to it; he tries to take in with mind and senses everything he can about it; he thinks about it, instead of about himself or what it might cause to happen to him; he grapples with it boldly, imaginatively, resourcefully, and if not confidently at least hopefully; if he fails to master it, he looks without shame or fear at his mistakes and learns from them. This is intelligence. Clearly its roots lie in a certain feeling about life, and one's self with respect to life. Just as clearly, unintelligence is not what most psychologists seem to suppose, the same thing as intelligence only less of it. It is an entirely different style of behavior, arising out of an entirely different set of attitudes.

Years of watching and comparing bright children and the not bright, or less bright, have shown that they are very different kinds of people. The bright child is curious about life and reality, eager to get in touch with it, embrace it, unite himself with it. There is no wall, no barrier between him and life. The dull child is far less curious, far less interested in what goes on and what is real, more inclined to live in worlds of fantasy. The bright child likes to experiment, to try things out. He lives by the maxim that there is more than one way to skin a cat. If he can't do something one-way, he'll try another. The dull child is usually afraid to try at all. It takes a good deal of urging to get him to try even once; if that try fails, he is through.

The bright child is patient. He can tolerate uncertainty and failure, and will keep trying until he gets an answer. When all his experiments fail, he can even admit to himself and others that for the time being he is not going to get an answer. This may annoy him, but he can wait. Very often, he does not want to be told how to do the problem or solve the puzzle he has struggled with, because he does not want to be cheated out of the chance to figure it out for himself in the future. Not so the dull child. He cannot stand uncertainty or failure. To him, an unanswered question is not a challenge or an opportunity but a threat. If he can't find the answer quickly, it must be given to him, and quickly; and he must have answers for everything. Such are the children of whom a second-grade teacher once said, "But my children like to have questions for which there is only one answer." They did; and by a mysterious coincidence, so did she.

The bright child is willing to go ahead on the basis of incomplete understanding and information. He will take risks, sail uncharted seas, explore when the landscape is dim, the landmarks few, the light poor. To give only one example, he will often read books he does not understand in the hope that after a while enough understanding will emerge to make it worthwhile to go on. In this spirit some of my fifth- graders tried to read Moby-Dick. But the dull child will go ahead only when he thinks he knows exactly where he stands and exactly what is ahead of him. If he does not feel he knows exactly what an experience will be like, and if it will not be exactly like other experiences he already knows, he wants no part of it. For while the bright child feels that the universe is, on the whole, a sensible, reasonable, and trustworthy place, the dull child feels that it is senseless, unpredictable, and treacherous. He feels that he can never tell what may happen, particularly in a new situation, except that it will probably be bad.

At a teacher's college in Illinois I said that thinking about such apparently tiny and trivial matters as how better to teach children to read or add or spell had made my daily work as a teacher enormously challenging and exciting.

[I remember DFW saying in his recollections of his teaching career that he found teaching got very boring after a year or two.  But he seemed to spend a lot of time thinking about teaching.  Why did he find it boring and Holt find it endlessly fascinating?]

---

Worse yet, we are not honest about ourselves, our own fears, limitations, weaknesses, prejudices, motives. We present ourselves to children as if we were gods, all-knowing, all-powerful, always rational, always just, always right. This is worse than any lie we could tell about ourselves. I have more than once shocked teachers by telling them that when kids ask me a question to which I don't know the answer, I say, "I haven't the faintest idea"; or that when I make a mistake, as I often do, I say, "I goofed again"; or that when I am trying to do something I am no good at, like paint in watercolors or play a clarinet or bugle, I do it in front of them so they can see me struggling with it, and can realize that not all adults are good at everything. If a child asks me to do something that I don't want to do, I tell him that I won't do it because I don't want to do it, instead of giving him a list of "good" reasons sounding as if they had come down from the Supreme Court. Interestingly enough, this rather open way of dealing with children works quite well. If you tell a child that you won't do something because you don't want to, he is very likely to accept that as a fact which he cannot change; if you ask him to stop doing something because it drives you crazy, there is a good chance that, without further talk, he will stop, because he knows what that is like.

Behind much of what we do in school lie some ideas that could be expressed roughly as follows: (1) Of the vast body of human knowledge, there are certain bits and pieces that can be called essential, that everyone should know; (2) the extent to which a person can be considered educated, qualified to live intelligently in today's world and be a useful member of society, depends on the amount of this essential knowledge that he carries about with him; (3) it is the duty of schools, therefore, to get as much of this essential knowledge as possible into the minds of children. Thus we find ourselves trying to poke certain facts, recipes, and ideas down the gullets of every child in school, whether the morsel interests him or not, and even if there are other things that he is much more interested in learning.

...

The notion of a curriculum, an essential body of knowledge, would be absurd even if children remembered everything we "taught" them. We don't and can't agree on what knowledge is essential. The man who has trained himself in some special field of knowledge or competence thinks, naturally, that his specialty should be in the curriculum. The classical scholars want Greek and Latin taught; the historians shout for more history; the mathematicians urge more math and the scientists more science; the modern language experts want all children taught French, or Spanish, or Russian; and so on.

...

The idea of the curriculum would not be valid even if we could agree on what ought to be in it. For knowledge itself changes.

...

In economics at college I was taught many things that were not true of our economy then, and many more that are not true now. Not for many years after I left college did I learn that the Creeks, far from being a detached and judicious people surrounded by chaste white temples, were hot-tempered, noisy, quarrelsome, and liked to cover their temples with gold leaf and bright paint; or that most of the citizens of Imperial Rome, far from living in houses in which the rooms surrounded an atrium, or central court, lived in multistory tenements, one of which was perhaps the largest building in the ancient world.

...

Instead, we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever needs to be learned.

One of my brightest and boldest fifth-graders was deeply interested in snakes. He knew more about snakes than anyone I've ever known. The school did not offer herpetology; snakes were not in the curriculum; but as far as I was concerned, any time he spent learning about snakes was better spent than in ways I could think of to spend it; not least of all because, in the process of learning about snakes, he learned a great deal more about many other things than I was able to "teach" those unfortunates in my class who were not interested in anything at all.
